Today, we let MSK(Mary, Sally, Kelly) sisters out at 8 AM. They were excited and flapping their wings as usual. 
Near the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we were met with two little stray mallard ducklings. They 
suddenly showed up at our front door, chased by predators, and we took them in- raised them for 8 weeks.
They eventually grew old enough to fly over our gates. The night they flew away, I still remember we grabbed
our cardboard box, and walked around the whole neighborhood. In the end, we couldn't find them and hoped they
had found their home at the park nearby, with other mallard ducks. 

Through this experience, we learned how to raise ducksand found them to be very cute and charming pets. 
After a month, we decided to get three Kahki Campbell ducklings. Although we were unprepared for the two 
mallard ducklings in April, this time, we bought a brooder to use anda few textbooks to help.

It has been a few weeks now and they have grown into very beautiful ducks.
